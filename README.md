I had two inspirations to create this project:

- 1 - I wanted to learn and practice Nuxt
- 2 - I used to use a tool called Alihunter which was free, but now it has become paid. So I looked at how the tool works and made my own. And now it's free for anyone who wants to use it.

This tool tracks recent sales from Shopify e-commerce.

## How to use

Just paste the URL of a Shopify store and click **Consultar**, then a list of recent sales will be displayed. If you want to track the next sales, click **Iniciar Monitoramento** and the next sales will be displayed.
